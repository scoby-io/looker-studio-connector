## Privacy Policy

### 1. Data protection at scoby

#### General information

We would like to give you a short and concise overview of what happens to your personal data when you use the scoby website. First of all, for your understanding, personal data are all data with which you "can" be personally identified. You can also find more detailed information in our privacy policy.

#### Data collection on this website

Responsible for data collection on this website? As is so often the case, data processing on this website is carried out by the website operator, in our case scoby GmbH. You can find the exact data under "Note on the responsible party" in this privacy policy.

#### How do we collect your data?

Basically, we collect your data when you provide it to us, i.e. when you communicate it to us. This can be, for example, information that you enter in a contact form. However, there are also other data that are collected automatically or only after your consent when you visit the website by our IT systems. This is mainly technical data (e.g. Internet browser, operating system or time of page view). This data is collected automatically as soon as you enter our website.

#### What is your data used for?

On the one hand, data is collected to ensure error-free provision of the website. On the other hand, other data may be used to analyze your user behavior.

#### What rights do you have regarding your data?

In principle, you always have the right to receive information free of charge about the origin, recipient, and purpose of your stored personal data. You also have the right to request the correction or deletion of this data. If you have given your consent to data processing, you can revoke this consent at any time for the future. You also have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances. Furthermore, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.

You are welcome to contact us in this regard and also enter into a dialogue with us

### 2. General notes and mandatory information

#### Data protection

For scoby, as the operator of these pages, it is a matter of course and our declared aim to take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this data protection declaration. However, various personal data are collected when you use our website. Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. With this data protection declaration, we want to explain to you what data we collect and what we use it for, how this is done and for what purpose. In doing so, we want to give you a secure feeling with regard to the use of data. With today's technological developments, we would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can also have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is difficult, if not impossible.

#### The responsible party

The responsible party for data processing on this website is:

scoby GmbH i.G. 
c/o BoH-Loft Ronsdorfer Strasse 77a 
40233 Duesseldorf 
telephone: +49 (0)211 94 25 26 10 
E-mail: datenschutz@scoby.io

The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses or similar).

#### Retention period

Apart from special storage periods explicitly listed here, your personal data will only remain with us until the purpose for processing the data no longer applies. We will also delete your data on occasion if you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke consent for data processing, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data. These may be, for example, retention periods under tax or commercial law that oblige us to retain the data; in the latter case, the data will be deleted after these reasons have ceased to apply.

#### The legal grounds for data processing on our website

If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) DSGVO or Art. 9(2)(a) DSGVO, if special categories of data are processed pursuant to Art. 9(1) DSGVO. In the event of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49 (1) a DSGVO.

If your data is required for the onduct of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO. Furthermore, if your data is required for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. c DSGVO. Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this data protection declaration.

#### Revocation of your consent to data processing

Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.

IF DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E OR F DSGVO, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 21(1) DSGVO).

IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 21 (2) OF THE GERMAN DATA PROTECTION ACT).

#### Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority

In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged violation. The right of appeal is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.

#### Right to data portability

You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in performance of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.

#### SSL or TLS encryption

For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or requests that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.

If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.

#### Information, deletion and correction

Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, their origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.

#### Right to restriction of processing

You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:

- If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
    
- If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion. 
- If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of erasure.  

- If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balancing of your and our interests must be carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. 
- If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data - apart from its storage - may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.

### 4. Processing of customer and contract data.

If you make use of our services and enter into a contract with us, we collect, process and use your personal customer and contract data for the purpose of establishing, defining the content of and amending our joint contractual relationship.

We collect, process and use personal data about the use of our website (usage data) only to the extent necessary to enable the user to use the service or to bill the user. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO.

Your collected customer data will be deleted after completion of the order or termination of the business relationship and expiration of any existing legal retention periods. Legal retention periods must remain unaffected. We ask for your understanding in this regard.

#### Data transfer upon conclusion of contract for services and digital content

We transmit personal data to third parties only if this is necessary in the context of the contract, for example, to the credit institution entrusted with the processing of payments.

Further transmission of data does not take place or only if you have expressly consented to the transmission. Your data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent, for example for advertising purposes.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO, which permits the processing of data for the fulfillment of a contract or pre-contractual measures.
